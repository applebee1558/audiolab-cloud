# Cider Audio Lab (Cloud)
Cider Audio Lab will **no longer** ship with Cider by default in the near future.

> Users will have a prompt upon clicking onto the Audio Lab submenu to download all the required impulses if they choose legacy Audio Lab which will be discontinued.

Audio Lab releases from the ThanksgivingÂ revision and onward will be entirely based on fetching logic and pre-rendered impulses from the cloud,
not only will this decrease resource usage on the client-side but it will also allow the Acoustic Technologies team on pushing revisions big or small without users having to redownload their Cider every time.
